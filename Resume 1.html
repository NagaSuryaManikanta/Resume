This approach offers an added advantage as you can easily swap out the projects category depending on the type of job you are applying for without having to rewrite your entire resume. For example, you may have one set of projects that demonstrate your management and leadership capabilities that you would use when applying for a supervisory position, and another set of projects that demonstrate your sales acumen you would insert when you are searching for a high-volume sales job.</p>
